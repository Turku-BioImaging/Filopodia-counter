# Filopodia Counter

Filopodia Counter is a script for automated filopodia counting from single cell images. It expects a multichannel image (2-4 channels). The cell needs to be stained with at least two markers, one that indicates filopodia tips and another that defines the cell area.

**Figure 1:** Example image for filopodia counter. In the image the cell body had been detected using an actin dye (white) and the every filopodia tip has been detected by staining myosin 10 (magenta).

## Dependencies

Filopodia counter in dependent on Fiji-plugins MorpholibJ and BioFormats. Please subscribe to these through the Fiji updater.

**Figure 2:** User interface of the Filopodia counter

1. Download the macro _filopodia-counter-v4.ijm_ from this repository and drag-and-drop it into Fiji.
2. Add files to be corrected. You can count filopodia in just one image or add multiple images. All these images will be processed with the same parameters.
3. Select the channel with the filopodia stain (options C1, C2, C3, C4).
4. Select the channel with the cell body stain (options C1, C2, C3, C4).
5. Select the path to results folder.
6. Select prominence (= signal relative to the local background). Higher prominence detects less filopodia tips.
7. Click _OK_

The script will output

- CSV file containing the name of each processed file
- Quality control image of each processed image
